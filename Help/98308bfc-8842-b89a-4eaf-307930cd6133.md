## Methods
&nbsp;<table><tr><th></th><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>![Public method](media/pubmethod.gif "Public method")![Static member](media/static.gif "Static member")</td><td><a href="ed1a6ad9-0fea-97c4-6967-05fb00ab99a8">UseHttpCorrelator</a></td><td>
Use this to add a correlation ID to your http responses and requests to enable the correlation of events across multiple services and clients. By default the correlation ID is stored in a header with the name correlation-id but this can be changed with the httpCorrelationHeaderKey parameter. If the request has an existing correlation header then this is added to the request, if no header is present then a GUID is generated and used as the ID and added to both the request and the response.</td></tr><tr><td>![Public method](media/pubmethod.gif "Public method")![Static member](media/static.gif "Static member")</td><td><a href="2abbb256-c570-d1a1-a5f3-66a1b9585e82">UseHttpLogger</a></td><td>
In order to capture the full set of data during a HTTP request this OWIN plugin must be the first plugin in the chain. Configure OWIN to trace HTTP requests and responses. Note that capturing request query parameters and request and response data could cause data security issues - potentially sensitive data will be logged to Azure table storage. Therefore by default none of this is captured.</td></tr></table>&nbsp;
